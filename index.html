            <h1>Webcomic Commlab 2020</h1>
            <p>Life is not easy these days, but it certainly wasn’t easy hundreds of thousands of years ago when we lived in caves. One wrong move while throwing your hunting spear at your game and you’ll starve for the day. You could be chilling on a sunny day and some random mammoth chases you and you trip over a stone and fall in a trap set by another hunter gatherer and die. You eat the wrong veggie? you die. You live alone? you die. You hang out with the wrong folks?…
                <br> <br>

                Roots is a survival web comic that’s portrayed as cave art. It follows the story of a caveman who has to make a series of careful decisions every day in order to survive.

                But it’s not easy living in the wild world, is it? Would YOU survive?
